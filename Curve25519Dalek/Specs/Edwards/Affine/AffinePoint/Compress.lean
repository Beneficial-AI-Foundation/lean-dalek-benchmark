/-! # Spec Theorem for `AffinePoint::compress`

Specification and proof for `edwards.affine.AffinePoint.compress`.

This function converts an Edwards affine point (x, y) into its 32-byte
CompressedEdwardsY representation by serializing y in little-endian and
storing the sign bit of x in the most significant bit of the last byte.

Natural language description:

    • Takes an affine Edwards point with coordinates (x, y)
    • Serializes y to a 32-byte little-endian array
    • Computes the sign (parity) bit of x as a subtle.Choice
    • Sets the MSB (bit 7) of byte 31 of the serialized y to this sign bit (via XOR)
    • Returns the resulting 32-byte array as CompressedEdwardsY

Natural language specs:

    • The function always succeeds (no panic)
    • On success, returns a CompressedEdwardsY (U8x32) where:
      - Bytes 0–30 and the low 7 bits of byte 31 encode the y-coordinate in little-endian
      - The high bit of byte 31 encodes the sign (parity) of the x-coordinate
-/

/-- **Spec and proof concerning `edwards.affine.AffinePoint.compress`**:
- Requires: `y`-coordinate of the AffinePoint, when converted to 32 bytes, has leading bit zero
- Returns a CompressedEdwardsY equal to the input AffinePoint
