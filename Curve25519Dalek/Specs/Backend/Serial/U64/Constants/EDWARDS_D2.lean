natural language description:

    • constants.EDWARDS_D2 is a constant representing 2*d (mod p) whereby d is a
      parameter in the defining curve equation ax^2 + y^2 = 1 + dx^2y^2.
    • The field element constants.EDWARDS_D2 is represented as five u64 limbs (51-bit limbs)

natural language specs:

    • Field51_as_Nat(constants.EDWARDS_D2) = 2*d (mod p) where d is the mathematical representation
      of the Edwards curve parameter as a natural number.

/-- **Spec and proof concerning `backend.serial.u64.constants.EDWARDS_D2`**:
- The value of constants.EDWARDS_D2 when converted to a natural number equals
  the canonical (reduced) representation of 2*d (mod p) in [0, p-1].
