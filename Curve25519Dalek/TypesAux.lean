/-! # Auxiliary theorems for Types

Theorems which are useful for proving spec theorems in this project but aren't available upstream.
This file is for theorems which depend on Types.lean (the Aeneas-generated types) in addition to
Defs.lean. For theorems that only depend on Defs.lean, use Aux.lean instead.
